    <p class="u-colorBlueDark u-textLarger">Ghana</p>

    <p>Ghana is a multicultural nation of some 27 million people, located along the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean in West Africa. Over the past two decades, Ghana's economy has grown to become one of the strongest and most diversified in Africa. This growth has significantly reduced the level of poverty in the region — according to the World Bank, the poverty level has dropped from 51 percent in 1991 to its current level of about 24 percent.</p>

    <p>Young people between the ages of 15 and 24 make up close to 20 percent of the Ghana population. Though Ghana’s youth are attaining higher levels of education than ever before, their participation in labor markets has been in decline. It is estimated that the youth unemployment rate is 14.9 percent.</p>

    <p class="u-colorBlueDark u-textLarger">Tamale</p>

    <p>Tamale is the third largest city in Ghana, and the capital of the country’s Northern Region. Historically formed around an important trade crossroad, Tamale has in recent years experienced a high degree development, which has produced a new stadium and an international airport.</p>

    <p>In Tamale, the informal business sector is by far the largest employer. Indeed, self-employment and small business entrepreneurship is very popular, and on the rise, especially among young women. Other important sources of employment in Tamale include agriculture, services and sales, crafts, the nonprofit sector, and the government.</p>

    <p class="u-colorBlueDark u-textLarger">Accra</p>

    <p>A sprawling metropolis of approximately 2,291,352 residents, Accra is the capital of Ghana, and its administrative, economic, and educational center. Accra’s primary economic activities are financial and government services, communications, construction, transport, and agriculture. The city is also home to over 70% of the country’s manufacturing capacity.</p>

    <p>Though Accra is one of the wealthiest and most modern cities on the African continent, it is also beset by problems that include congestion, pollution, and poverty. Youth unemployment is a major problem in the capital, with an estimated 30% unemployment rate for people between the ages of 15 and 24.</p>

    <p class="u-colorBlueDark u-textLarger">Northern Ghana</p>

    <p>In general, the Northern Region of Ghana is less populated and urbanized compared the most parts of the country, and has also experienced lesser rate of growth and prosperity. Youth between the ages of 20 and 35 in this region make up about 25% of the total population. Among youth in the Northern Region, there currently exists lower levels of education and literacy compared to the general population, and a significant gap in these levels between men and women.</p>

        <br/>

        <br/>
